# The project is still in Progress!

I have created a Hospital Management System that using JSWINGS and MYSQL DBMS with Apache XAMPP. The system will allow you to establish a role as either an administrator, doctor or patient and insert, delete, retrieve corresponding data.  As a doctor, you will be able to add, view  or delete patient records and admit or discharge patients. As an administrator, you will be able to add or fire doctors and view doctors details. As a patient you will be able to view your and your doctors information.
